# DND Reimplementation

## ðŸš€ My schedule

*read and understand the paper*

- [X] prepare the data
  you can get the data at [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/sanyier312/DND-Reimplementation/tree/main/data/synthetic)
- [X] find out the input and output
- [X] draw the model architecture  flow chart
  ![](20250514213026.png)
- [X] define the loss function

Given a graph $G = (V, E)$, each node $v_i \in V$ has a ground truth label $y_i \in [0, 1]$,
and the model predicts a value $\hat{y}_i \in [0, 1]$.

The Mean Squared Error loss is defined as:

- [ ] define the evaluation metrics

*coding*

- [X] define the training and evaluation process
- [X] define the hyperparameters
- [X] process the data
- [X] train the model
- [ ] evaluate the model
- [ ] visualize the results

## ðŸ“Œ Structure

- `model/` â€” GAT + MLP model
- `scripts/` â€” Training and evaluation scripts
- `data/` â€” Synthetic and real-world directed networks
- `results/` â€” Logs, plots, metrics

## ðŸ”§ Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# ðŸ“ˆ Results

*train the model with  ER dataset*
