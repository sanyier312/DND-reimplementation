# DND Reimplementation

This project is a reimplementation of the paper:

**DND: Deep Learning-Based Directed Network Disintegrator**, IEEE JETCAS, 2023.


##  ? My schedule

*read and understand the paper*   
- [x] prepare the data
- [ ] find out the input and output
- [ ] draw the Algorithm flow chart
- [ ] draw the model architecture details
- [ ] define the loss function
- [ ] define the evaluation metrics

*coding*
- [ ] define the training and evaluation process
- [ ] define the hyperparameters
- [ ] process the data
- [ ] train the model
- [ ] evaluate the model
- [ ] visualize the results



## ? Structure
- `model/` ！ GAT + MLP model
- `scripts/` ！ Training and evaluation scripts
- `data/` ！ Synthetic and real-world directed networks
- `results/` ！ Logs, plots, metrics

## ? Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
